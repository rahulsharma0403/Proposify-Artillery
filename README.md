Steps:
1. To download the report wait for the action workflow to complete.
2. Open the workflow run that was just completed and scroll at the bottom to see the artifact.
3. Download the artifact and open it locally.
4. It will open the artillery_report.html file. ( I have used the default html reporter as suggested, though this can be integrated with the Allure reporting as well for better graphs and charts)
